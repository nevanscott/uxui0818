Write a report about your [Wellness App]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/design-thinking/wellness.md %}). This may be similar to a written version of your presentation, but you'll have the opportunity to go into more detail.

Next week, bring this with you to your 1-on-1 with one of the TAs, to review the project with them.
