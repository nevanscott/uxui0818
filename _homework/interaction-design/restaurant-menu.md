To start practicing your typography and composition chops, we're going to take a break from designing for the screen and turn our attention to print.

**Note:** You'll have time to get started on this assignment during workshop.

Assignment
----------

Redesign a restaurant menu.


Directions
----------

1. Find a PDF of a restaurant menu online. <small>(Try searching on [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com))</small>
2. Use the contents of the menu to create a new design.


Requirements
------------

- Design just the *inside* of the menu. Not the cover. If it's a long menu, just design 2 pages of it (1 spread).
- We are printing these menus in *black and white* on A4 paper. <small>(Shades of grey are okay.)</small>
- We do not have a budget to license fonts, so please choose an open-source font from [Google Fonts][].
- Limit yourself to 1–2 fonts.
- Limit yourself to text—no icons, no illustrations, no photos, no color.


Suggestions
-----------

- Install [SkyFonts][] to sync fonts from [Google Fonts][] to your computer.
- If you have limited experience with print design, seek out guidance from your peers who have more experience. Remember, we are all [developing our eye](https://ia.net/topics/learning-to-see), and using your eye to help others is just as much an opportunity to practice as working on your own.


Stretch
-------

If you need an extra challenge, find a bilingual menu (in two languages you are familiar with) to redesign.


Font Recommendations
--------------------

There are so so so many fonts to comb through on [Google Fonts][], so in an effort to make your life easier, here are some to get you started.
