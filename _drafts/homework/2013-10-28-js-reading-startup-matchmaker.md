### Note

I am only making the homepage of the Startup Matchmaker site required, because there is quite a bit of watching and reading that I'm assigning. Please take some time to at least look over all of the materials, even if you aren't able to watch everything through or read everything in detail. The [second chapter](http://eloquentjavascript.net/chapter2.html) of Eloquent JavaScript covers much of the same material we will be going over on Monday, so even if it is difficult to follow, it should make our discussion on Monday that much more palatable for you.


Optional
--------
