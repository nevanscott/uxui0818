The Brief
---------

You will be proposing a new mobile app designed to support wellness. Based on user research, you'll identify an opportunity for an app to improve people's day-to-day lives.


Suggestions
-----------

- Use findings from surveys and interviews to identify pain points in people's lives to help determine a direction for your product. You should be trying to solve *real* people's *real* problems. **Don't start with a concept!**
- Interview people from outside of campus. Use your network to talk to people you don't really know.
- Don't forget to test and iterate! This will help you develop a prototype that has the kinks worked out of it.
- Test on paper before going digital.
- **Document as you go.** Take photos and collect artifacts from your work. Especially keep track of the changes as you iterate on your prototype.


Presentation <small>(6 minutes)</small>
------------

Your presentation should answer the following questions:

1. What did your research show you?
2. What variations on your design did you explore?
3. How were your design decisions connected to your research findings?
4. How would a user operate your final design?
5. How did you design change based on testing with users?
6. What would you do differently next time?


Prototype
---------

For this project, use Sketch and Invision to make a low-fidelity version of your prototype.

- Stick to black and white <small>(use 1 shade of grey if needed)</small>
- Just use 1 font <small>(probably Avenir or Helvetica)</small>
- Use representative text content <small>(no lorem ipsum)</small>
- Use boxes with Xs in place of images

**Tip:** If you haven't set it up already, use the [Craft plugin](https://www.invisionapp.com/craft) for Sketch to make it easier to sync your Sketch artboards to Invision.


Report
------

For this project, you'll be delivering a presentation as well as submitting a written report. The report is an opportunity for you to document your process, findings, takeaways, and iterations. It's good practice to document as much as you can while you work, so we're starting that practice early. This will make your life much easier later when you start compiling a portfolio of your work.

The report will also serve as the focal point for a 1-on-1 feedback session with one of the TAs.

We'll have time dedicated after the presentations of this project to write up the report. For more information, check out the lesson on [Design Reports]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _lessons/design-thinking/design-reports.md %}).
